## Why OS-Portfolio-Projects?

### The Portfolio Problem

Traditional data engineering portfolios showcase isolated skills—SQL queries, Python scripts, CSV analysis—in controlled environments. But production engineering is different:
- Teams collaborate across timezones
- Requirements evolve mid-sprint
- Systems must balance cost, performance, and reliability
- Decisions require trade-off analysis and documentation

**Most portfolios can't prove you've done this.**

### Our Solution: Real Collaborative Projects

Open Source Portfolio Projects is a Datech's community initiative where data engineers propose and build **real production-grade systems** together:

- **Multi-contributor teams** - Work with 2-10 engineers like in real companies
- **Separate repositories** - Each project gets its own repo, roadmap, and team
- **Production complexity** - Live data generation, failure scenarios, cost constraints
- **Evolving requirements** - Phase 2 "twists" that mirror real sprint planning
- **Full portfolio credit** - Detailed CONTRIBUTORS.md with LinkedIn-ready mentions
- **Architecture-first** - Document decisions in ADRs, not just write code

### Real Outcomes

Contributors report:
- **Portfolio differentiation** - Projects that stand out in competitive markets
- **Team experience** - Demonstrable collaboration, not just solo work
- **Interview confidence** - Real stories about production trade-offs
- **Community connections** - Network with data engineers worldwide

---

## How It Works

### 1. Propose a Project

Have an idea for a data engineering system?

**Submit a proposal:**
- Based on production experience
- Includes Phase 2 twist (requirements evolution)
- Defines team needs and skills
- Simulates real business context

→ [Propose a Project](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/project_proposal.md)

**If approved:**
- Maintainers create separate repository
- You're assigned as project lead (usually)
- Project opens for contributor applications
- You coordinate the team

---

### 2. Join a Project

Want to contribute to an existing project?

**Browse active projects:**
- See what's being built
- Check required skills
- Review team composition
- Read the Phase 2 twist

→ [Browse All Projects](PROJECTS.md)

**Apply to join:**
- Submit application via project's "Join Project" template
- Project lead reviews (3-5 days)
- If approved, added as collaborator
- Start contributing!

---

### 3. Build Together

**Teams collaborate to build production-grade systems:**

**Phase 1: Foundation** (1-2 months)
- Core data ingestion
- Basic transformations
- Initial infrastructure
- Validators and tests

**Phase 2: The Twist** (2-4 weeks)
- Requirements change (new source, tighter SLA, compliance rule)
- Team adapts the system
- Simulates production reality
- Documents architectural decisions

**Phase 3: Optimization** (2-4 weeks)
- Cost optimization
- Performance tuning
- Monitoring/observability
- Production readiness

---

### 4. Get Credit

**Your contributions are documented:**

**In the project:**
- Name and role in CONTRIBUTORS.md
- Detailed contribution descriptions
- GitHub contribution graph
- LinkedIn mention templates

**In your portfolio:**
- Link to live project repository
- Describe your specific contributions
- Reference architectural decisions
- Demonstrate team collaboration

---

## Core Principles

### Real Systems, Real Complexity

Projects use containerized services (Postgres, Kafka, REST APIs) to generate live, evolving data streams. You'll handle late-arriving data, duplicates, schema evolution, and corrupt records—not perfect CSVs.

### Change is the Only Constant

Every project includes a Phase 2 twist. Requirements shift midway—new data sources, tighter SLAs, compliance changes. This mirrors production engineering where systems must continuously adapt.

### Cost-Conscious Engineering

Budget constraints are built into every project. Teams optimize query performance, choose storage tiers, and justify compute costs. Real engineering means balancing capabilities against cloud spend.

### Architecture Over Code

Teams document key decisions in Architecture Decision Records (ADRs): Why Spark over Pandas? Why star schema? What trade-offs? Strong engineering means explaining reasoning, not just writing code.

### Collaborative Development

Projects succeed through teamwork:
- Code reviews and pair programming
- Async-first communication
- Clear task ownership
- Conflict resolution
- Shared learning

---

## Project Examples

### Active Projects

**Open F1 Data Warehouse (Intermediate)**

Design and build an analytical data warehouse using Formula 1 race data from the Open F1 API. The goal is to transform raw race weekend data such as sessions, lap times, drivers, and telemetry—into a structured warehouse that supports analytics and historical exploration.

Participants will design ingestion pipelines, model the data, and build analytics-ready tables that allow fans and developers to explore trends across races, drivers, and seasons.

What you'll build

Data ingestion pipeline from the Open F1 API

Staging layer for raw race data

Dimensional models for drivers, races, laps, and telemetry

Analytical tables for race performance and historical insights

SQL queries and dashboards for F1 analytics

**Apache Kafka Internals Lab** (Intermediate)
Learn how Kafka works internally by building and experimenting with a multi-broker cluster. Explore topics, partitions, offsets, replication, and consumer groups while observing how Kafka handles failures and distributed coordination.

## FAQ

### How is this different from solo challenges?

**Traditional challenges:** Complete pre-built exercises alone  
**OS-Portfolio-Projects:** Build new systems with teams

You get real collaboration experience, team coordination, and leadership opportunities—not just solo coding.

### Do I need to commit full-time?

No. Projects are async-first. Most contributors work 5-10 hours/week. Time commitments are discussed during application.

### What if I'm a beginner?

Perfect! We have beginner-level projects. Teams include mixed experience levels. You'll learn from others while contributing meaningfully.

### Can I work on multiple projects?

Yes! Many contributors work on 2-3 projects. Just be realistic about time commitments.

### What if a project stalls?

Project leads coordinate. If activity drops, maintainers check in. Projects can go dormant and be revived later, or archived gracefully.

### How do I prove I contributed?

- GitHub contribution graph (automatic)
- CONTRIBUTORS.md with your name and role
- Detailed contribution descriptions
- LinkedIn mention templates
- Your own portfolio with links to the project

### Can I become a project lead without proposing?

Yes! You can take over dormant projects or be promoted from contributor to lead on active projects.
